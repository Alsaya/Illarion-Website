<h1>Guild Rules</h1>

<?php Page::cap('T'); ?>
<p>he guild rules contain all rules which have to be kept in mind when founding
or leading a guild. These rules are essential to ensure that the founded guilds
do not vanish after a short time or become inactive too fast.</p>

<p>Also described is the way of founding a guild.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
	<li>A guild can be founded with at <b>least four active members</b>. It is
	important that the guild members are played by different players.</li>
	<li>A guild has to have a concept. A summary of the guidelines of the guild
	and what the guild stands for. Should this concept be secret and not
	readable for everyone, it can be sent to a gamemaster for examination.</li>
	<li>Every guild has a probation time of three weeks in which its members and
	the activity of the guild is monitored, to see if the guild is beneficial
	for the game.</li>
	<li>When a guild becomes inactive, and therefor has not enough active
	members, the property of the guild will either decay or be taken over by
	another guild.</li>
	<li>New guilds have to be approved by a gamemaster.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Considerations before founding a guild</h2>

<p>Before a guild is made public, you should consider some things to make sure
that the guild can exist the way you envision it to do.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Would the guild break any rules in Illarion? If so, the guild will be
	rejected.</li>
	<li>Can I inspire other players with my idea? This is one of the most
	important points. When a guild can't inspire players one way or another,
	creating it makes no sense. One way to find out how others feel about your
	guild, is to post about it on the boards. Realise though, that people will
	not always be positive.</li>
	<li>Do I promise my members something in my concept I cannot hold? Nothing
	is more harmful for a guild than demotivated members which realized that
	they won't get from the guild what they hoped for.</li>
	<li>One of the most important points: Have enough time to found and lead the
	guild. Especially during the creation and the months after it, the time you
	need to lead the guild shouldn't be underestimated. If you cannot spend this
	time, you cannot found the guild no matter how good the concept is.</li>
	<li>Does the guild I want to found already exist in the same or a similar
	form? If so, you should take part in the existing guild and not found a new
	one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>First Step to a new guild - The concept</h2>

<p>The concept is the first thing one should think about before the creation. It
describes what the guild really is and what it stands for. The concept has to be
written, independent of whether it is a secret or not, so that a gamemaster can
evaluate if the guild fits into the world of Illarion.</p>

<p>The concept should contain the following points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>History of origins of the guild: Why will it be founded and by whom?
	This point should be based on the game or fit in the background story of
	Illarion.</li>
	<li>Description of the guild</li>
	<li>Set goals, missions, spirit and purpose of the guild: This point is
	especially important. The goals serve a long time motivation for the members
	and should be set accordingly. Guilds, whose only goal is to build houses
	will categorially be rejected. The spirit and purpose of the guild should
	especially display how the new guild differs from any existing guild and how
	it adds to the enhancement of the game.</li>
	<li>Eventual extra informations about the guild like functions and positions
	within the guild. This is wholely optional, but it might be good to think
	about these kind of things before founding your guild.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Second Step to a new guild - Let the guild be checked</h2>

<p>In the next step you guild needs to be checked. For that you should send the
complete concept as well as the <b>exact</b> names of the first members to a
gamemaster, who will read it and accept the guild or not. When the guild is
accepted you can start a thread on the guildboard. If the concept will be made
public or not is the choice of the guild leader.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<h2>Third Step to a new guild - Survive the probation</h2>

<p>During probation, which lasts about three weeks, the members of the new guild
will be watched more closely. If the members stand out with inadequate roleplay
or rulebreaking behavior, it could mean the end of the guild. The guild will
also have to show that it can keep the members active.</p>

<p>If there are no problems during probation, the group gets the status of a
real guild and has now the right of the amenities of a guild, for example to
build a guild house.</p>
