<h2>Download client</h2>

<h3>System requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Operating system:
    <ul>
      <li>Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, XP 64bit, Vista, Vista 64bit, 7, 7 64bit</li>
      <li>Linux Kernel 2.4.20 or newer (32bit und 64bit)</li>
      <li>MacOS X 10.4 Tiger, 10.5 Leopard, 10.6 Snow Leopard</li>
      <li>Solaris 8, 9, 10 (only 32bit)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Graphic card: 32MB memory, driver with openGL support</li>
  <li>CPU: 700 MHz and better</li>
  <li>A Java 1.5 runtime environment or higher</li>
</ul>

<p>Windows Vista, Windows 7 and the most Linux version do not have a graphic driver with OpenGL installed out of the box. Such a driver can be downloaded and installed from the homepage of
    the vendor of your graphic card.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Download the Illarion client here.</p>
<p>The initial download size is about 34MB, when the client is updated, only those parts will be downloaded that have actually changed, mostly around 500kB-5MB. Updates will be detected and installed automatically.</p>
<p>During installation you must confirm that you want to trust a certificate from "Thawte Consulting". Just confirm this dialog. Upon the first launch the client will ask you for a folder to store your characters' data in (e.g. maps). Just select a folder of your choice. If you have played before, you can also select your existing character directory. The data of your existing characters will be imported (backup is recommended!).</p>
<p>If the client does not start up, make sure you have an up to date Java Runtime Enviroment installed.</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/illarion/download/illarion_client.jnlp">Online Installation</a> (latest version, Windows, Linux, Solaris and MacOS X, 34MB)</li>
   <li><a href="http://jdl.sun.com/webapps/getjava/BrowserRedirect?locale=us&amp;host=java.com">Java Runtime Enviroment</a> (from java.com)</li>
</ul>

<p>In case there are any problems during the installation, feel free to ask for help using the IRC chat or the board. There are barely problems that can't be solved.</p>
