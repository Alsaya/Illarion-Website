   <h2>Narg&ugrave;n - God of Chaos </h2>

   <p>Prayed to for:<br />
   Luck, playing tricks, intelligent revenge, desperate people might place their life under his
   will</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   Chaotic, very intelligent, often friendly, plays mean tricks on some people. Much black humor.
   If blessed by his hand everything becomes possible, with a good or bad outcome.</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   Always in disguise, his true shape is not known to mankind. Often appears as a black dressed
   rogue or thief, wearing noble and tasteful clothing. Sometimes wears ear rings. Appears as a
   huge black raven, perhaps that&#39;s why people think ravens bring bad luck...</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   Likes to play with everything: Intrigues, mean or funny tricks are his elements. Sometimes just
   helps people, sometimes destroys them, often makes a big show of it. Likes to show people how
   small they really are. He has few followers and many people say that they must be insane as his
   favor and loyalty comes and goes like the wind.</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   His followers are few, and most people simply do not mention his name not to attract his
   attention. They believe that everything happens accidentally, and to make a fortune, one must
   play with high risk to have fun. Many gamblers pray to Narg&ugrave;n, and some mad people claim to be
   chaos priests. But most of these people seem quite insane, a price for the unreliable power
   Narg&ugrave;n gives - if he gives any. Mad prophets or hermits, or babbling idiots and a few orc
   shamans, sometimes claim to be Narg&ugrave;n priests. Their insanity seems to grant them a different
   point of view, and often much wisdom lies in the madness of a real Narg&ugrave;n priest. But most of
   Narg&ugrave;n&#39;s followers do not admit who they follow, and pretend something else. Some jesters
   are Narg&ugrave;n followers too. Their believes are totally varying, for example the mad prophet who
   wrote the &quot;Very Sacred Book of MOO&quot; and the &quot;Unbelievable Stuff of BOO&quot;, did
   believe that when people die, they have to choose an intelligent leader cow from a herd that
   shows them places with &quot;funny mushrooms&quot; to see great colors and visions.</p>
