   <h2>Eldan - God of Spirit </h2>

   <p>Element: Spirit</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   wise, quiet, pensive, ivory-tower</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   appears as a mage, scholar, sometimes as a beggar or drunken philosopher; carries a wooden
   pole-staff</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   dislikes the big cities or large crowds, preferes solitude but seldom can be found in remote
   inns</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   Eldan has never been active amongst mortals. Very few people pray to him. But since he was never
   heard or seen in public, no one knows how to identify him. His few believers do not talk much
   about him, and there are many rumors that he still wanders around in Illarion in disguise.
   People who follow him are often hermits, or people who love drinks and long philosophical talks
   - all claim to have met him personally, and instead of praying, they talk or discuss with empty
   places.</p>
