   <h2>Tanora - Goddess of Water</h2>

   <p>Element: Water</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   wise, quiet, just, patient, sometimes sad</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   appears as a lizardwoman or as an ageless mermaid</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   likes the unadorned beauty; the only elder god who still often walks on earth, maybe in search
   of something long lost to her</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   Tanora is the only still active Elder God in Illarion. Her religion dominates the lizard
   society. Many of her temples lie under water, and most are located at the centre of the
   lizardmen&#39;s under water towns. In the native language of the lizardman she is called
   &quot;Zshhel- pheey- arrr&quot;, almost unspeakable for the human tongue, and lately often
   called &quot;Zelphia&quot;. Some legends say that when the Elder Gods left, Tanora gave her
   believers to Zelphia; but both Tanora and Zelphia are the same person. She herself had been
   assuring this to several mortal beings. The lizardmen, however, always knew her as
   Zelphia.<br />
   Most Zelphia believers are Lizards, sailors, or even elves. Many healers pray to her too. Her
   followers believe that she is a very powerful righteous goddess. Since most of her lizard
   priests follow ancient traditions, some might be quite fanatic believers who crush evil beings
   wherever they can, while many other followers are very pieceful in nature. Zelphia followers
   believe that the world and the magic are all one flow, and life springs from it where ever the
   goddess touches it. They think, that when they die, they will have to cross a sea with
   unbreathable water (for lizards). When they have been good beings, the goddess may even send
   them a boat, and when they have been bad, they must swim and get a stone pile over the sea. For
   every bad thing they did in life, a new stone is added to their pile. If the stone pile is too
   heavy, they have to wait for other swimmers who show mercy and take one or another stone with
   them. When they carry too many stones, they will not be able to cross the sea:<br />
   When they sink, the goddess will send them back to live as an animal that serves the mortals
   until the guilt is cleaned.</p>
