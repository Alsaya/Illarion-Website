   <h1>Introduction</h1>

   <h2>What is Illarion?</h2>

   <?php cap(I); ?>

   <p>llarion is a graphic online role playing game, where players from around the world can play together in a medievel environment.
    You create a character for yourself to explore the world of Illarion with.
	 You will meet many playing characters when you are in the game, however some characters are NPC's
	  (non playing characters). NPC's will help your character out with adventures, as well as selling 
	  them things, point them in the right direction, and also buy things from them. (See the NPC section).</p>
	  
	  <p>Role-Playing aspect makes up the game. You should create your own background story for your character,
	   and not from a movie, game, or book. Be creative, this way, other players as well as yourself will have
	    more fun role playing the parts.</p>
		
<p>There are great differences between this game and other games. This game has no high-scores,
 no beginning or end, and no winners or losers. Everything is in change, so you will find new things
  as you go along, and your character will grow stronger or weaker through time. When you first go in
   the game, you will be a traveler and everything will be new to you. But don't fret, for you will soon 
  learn how to play, and with some time you may even become well known.</p>

<p>You have much to learn. Your skills will rise only when you practice them,
 whereas they may fall when you do not practice them, or you are killed. (see skills section).</p>

<p>Something important, before we start: Illarion is not a commercial online-game.
 This means on the one hand, you will not have any costs except the online-fees,
  but on the other hand you are not entitled to play Illarion. There could arise downtimes
   because of maintenance work at the server. The Illarion-team is always amenable for proposals,
    suggestions, problem reports etc., but always remember not to demand something, but to suggest.
	 Keep in mind we are still in the beta versions of the game.</p>
