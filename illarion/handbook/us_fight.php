<p>As you have already read, Illarion is not your average combat based game, and the
 focus should not be on actual combat - but the role-play surrounding it. However,
  the land of Illarion is populated by many mighty warriors. And combat in the game
   can be very exciting and a lot of fun when done correctly. </p>


<p><b>The Basics</b></p>

<p>Combat is initiated by holding down the Ctrl-key and left-clicking on a target - once
 engaged in combat, your target will display a red square beneath it (outlining the tile
  it stands upon). Holding Ctrl and clicking the red square will then disengage that combat,
   but you can still be attacked. When a player loses all their hit points and the battle,
    they will turn into a cloud-like “spirit”, and will be told to head for the cross to be
	 resurrected. When you are resurrected, you will have lost some of your skills, 
	 and possibly some items, too. </p>

<p>There are some combat skills that your character can learn. 
Below are some of the most central ones and their meaning in the game: </p>
<i>Slashing</i>- The martial art of combat with bladed weapons<br /> 
<i>Concussion</i>- The use of blunt weapons in combat <br />
<i>Parry</i>- The ability to defend against attacks and thwart them <br />
<i>Dodge</i>- The skill to avoid attacks <br />
<i>Ranged</i>- Markmansship with distance weapons (i.e. crossbows) <br />

<p>There are many ways for your character to begin training in the various combat skills,
 and you would be well advised to have your character spend some time around warrior characters
 in the game. </p>


<p><b>Terms and rules of combat </b></p>

<p><i>"Rez-killing"</i>- Or, "resurrection-killing", is the act of killing someone after
 they have been sent to the cross already. Illarion is a strange and magical place, and no
  one can fully explain the restorative magic of the cross. However, no crime or insult is
   worth killing someone twice or more in a row. Killing someone repeatedly is frowned upon
    as weak roleplaying and can get you into serious trouble. At the same time, returning from
	 the cross to attack someone again is just as bad. </p>

<p><i>"PKing"</i>- Or, "Player-killing", is the act of killing another player-character
 without a real reason. Robbery is not a good reason, because you can rob someone with out
  attacking them (using the #me function). The best way to look at it is this: killing someone
   within the game is oftenly considered the lowest form of roleplaying, because it is entirely
    skill-based. It should be avoided, until your character realistically has few to no other options.</p> 

<p><i>Potions</i>- Healing potions can be used to regain health quickly. However, when in
 battle with another player, it is considered to be extremely bad roleplaying to use a potion
  while in combat. You should be at least one square away from your attacker to use a potion,
   or accompany the use of the potion with an elaborate #me explaining how you'd drink it in
    the middle of combat. </p>

<p><i>Opening combat</i>- There is a correct way to initiate combat in Illarion: always
 with the use of the #me-function. When attacking a fellow player, the more you write,
  the better, as it allows people more time to respond and react. The other reason is
   that in a crowd, it is oftenly impossible to see who is attacking you. #me is a clear
    sign to the player to know as a player who is attacking their character. The very least
	 you should always do is use "#me draws his/her weapon and attacks". </p>


<p><b>Final Note</b></p> 

<p>Remember, this is a roleplaying community. We are all here to have fun, so if combat
 is your character's thing - even if he or she is not a nice person - try and respect people's
  tastes and please do not force encounters to end with fighting. Always remember, with the
   #me-command, you can do <i>anything</i>. Just by clicking on someone, and making a red square,
    all you can do is turn them into a cloud.</p>
