   <h1>What is Roleplaying?</h1>


   <?php cap(M); ?>
<p>any players think they are good roleplayer. By their definition you will control one or more
 characters and lead them trough a more or less pre-set storyline, in which you have to attain
  a goal (for example: the victory over an evil power) and with the performance of this goal the
   game ends.</p>

<p>To attain the goal you have to rise your skills and gain experience. In Illarion is
 the definition different.</p>

<p>There are also Monsters to kill and the possibility to raise your skills, but at the end
 there are no winners and no losers. More importantly, in Illarion, you should strive to communicate
  and interact with other characters. The storyline of Illarion will live from this, and without it there
   will be stagnacy.</p>

<p>Therefore it is so important that the player behind the character can identify himself with
 the figure and let his character talk and behave only in that way like the personality of his
  character (role) allows to react and behave in an medieval fantasy-world.</p>
