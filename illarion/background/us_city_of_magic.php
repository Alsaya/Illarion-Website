<h2>-1,647: Founding of Lor-Angur</h2>

<p>Scholars of Albar discover ancient ruins and therein find magic artifacts and ancient
formulae. Shortly thereafter, they declare independance from Albar and begin to recruit
any citizens and peasants with any even little magical talents. The Albarian crown sends
forth riders, but they encounter an impassable barrier.</p>

<h2>-1,643: The Winter of Wolves</h2>

<p>During a harsh winter, several towns in the Albarian realm are attacked by wolves.
Even at the borders to the Salkamaerian lands, several wolves were sighted. Strangely
enough, many of these wolves focus on methodically attacking Albarian nobles and
soldiers. The Magi of Lor-Angur are made responsible for the happenings.</p>
<p>A larger legion advances to the small, but growing city of Lor-Angur come spring, but
they can not bypass or penetrate the barrier. Numerous Albarian soldiers desert to the
mage city.</p>

<h2>-1,627: The Expedition to Nabranoo</h2>

<p>The scholars of Lor-Angur let it be known that they have discovered the position of
the legendary golden city "Nabranoo" during excavations within an old temple. A delegate
of scholars, magi, and workforces departs for the direction of this fabled position, but
the troupe returns by the end of the year without any results. Some of the explorers
however remained in the wilderness to continue searching by themselves. They are to be
heard of never again.</p>

<h2>-1,612 until - 1,601: The Siege of Lor-Angur</h2>

<p>The magical barrier of the city which is fed by sunlight via three charged magical
crystal capacitators, begins to weaken. Because they fear an encroachment of Albarian
troops and the crystals would need at least a year to recharge, the city is restructured
into a fortress. The city requests for support from the Salkamaerian realm, but because
Lor-Angur is too deep within Albarian territory, this request is denied. The Emperor of
Salkamar, Regis Saldor Negus the I., however declares the "City of Magi" as Salkamaerian
Protectorate.</p>

<p>By autumn of -1,603, the barrier fades and disappears, and an Albarian legion begins
to lay siege upon Lor-Angur. In the beginning, the legion's losses are immense in cause
of the enemy's use of magic, as it seems the city's magi possess a far more large and
effective array of spells than the magi of the legion.</p>

<p>The Albarian army is so severely weakened that they have to cease their siege. By
spring of -1,601, a newly set up legion is sent by the crown again, but the barrier is
active once more. Due to the enormous costs provoked by the legion, the dwindling
numbers of workers providing less harvests, famine breaks out in the following winter
throughout Albar.</p>

<h2>-1,587 until -1,577: War Between Albar and Salkamar</h2>

<p>The city of Albar declares war to Salkamar. Among the reasons for the declaration is
the support Lor-Angur enjoys from Salkamar, but mainly the enmity of both cities. Gynk
remains neutral in the conflict. The following years are outlined by several skirmishes,
during which the Salkamaerian forces are oftenly supported by magi. Many of these
wizards are former Albarian peasants and see their opportunity to weaken the kingdom
with their support.</p>

<p>The war only ends when an Albarian legion attempting to bypass the bulk of the
Salkamaerian army ends up looting two halfling towns. The legion's upkeep was supposed
to be provided with this looting. The legion failed though against the remarkable
toughness and resilience of the halflings, who had set up an angry legion of their own
within shortest time. As the two legions stood against eachother, legions of
Salkamaerian riders and war-paladins arrived to the aid of the halfling legion, and the
Albarian forces finally retreated by the autumn of -1,577.</p>

<p>As winter comes along, all reserves of Albar are used up and a new famine drapes
itself over the realm. The Albarian ambassador obtains a peace treaty which costs Albar
all seven border towns and, for the first time for over a century, shifts the border
between Albar and Salkamar. Salkamar in turn begins to expand the border's battlements
with enormous assistance from the local peasants.</p>
