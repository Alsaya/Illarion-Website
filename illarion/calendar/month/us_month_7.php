	<h2>Month of Immolation</h2>

	<p>Bras is named after Br치gon, the third known creator god: he gave the sun and the
	fire to the world. The longest day in the year followed by the shortest night is the
	24th of Br치s.</p>

	<p>In this night, elves celebrate the feast of fire, in which on seas and rivers
	small, carven wood pieces swim and carry many candles. The humans have different way
	to celebrate this celebration. In Salkamar and Gynk this night is celebrated with a
	long grill feast, where all kinds of artists show they skills. In Albar just the
	nobles usually celebrate, but therefor their decadent feasts goes through the whole
	of Br치s. It's not unusally that they have a special tax enforced in many Albarian
	regions to finance this.</p>
