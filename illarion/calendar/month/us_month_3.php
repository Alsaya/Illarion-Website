	<h1>Zhas</h1>

	<h2>Month of Loyalty</h2>

	<p>Zhas was named after Zhambra, a main god of the Salkamaerian pantheon. The month
	of Zhas is a very busy time for peasants and fieldworkers around Albar and
	Salkamar.</p>

	<p>Some towns in Salkamar celebrate a poetry-festival in Zhas, possibly inspired by
	an elven celebration.</p>

	<p>On the 12th of Zhas, they celebrate a memorial. the "Day of the Cherry Blossom,"
	to remind that nothing lasts for eternity. Elven legends tell of the seperation and
	the fall of an elven house bearing the name of "Narnil." The descendants of this
	house are called "Erume-Lie."</p>

	<p>Well known is a translation of an ancient elven song from the libraries of Nanuk
	Moonsilver:</p>

	<p style="font-style:italic;">To the river i went alone,<br />
	Water to bail.<br />
	All around me delicately fell<br />
	The leaves of the cherry blossom.<br />
	With graceful ease they glide away,<br />
	In their dying beauty.<br />
	The water carried away the white splendor,<br />
	My heart to follow.<br />
	Freezing, the empty branches shiver<br />
	I am freezing in the wind.</p>
