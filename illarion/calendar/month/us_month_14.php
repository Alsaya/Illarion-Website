	<h2>Month of Four Winds</h2>

	<p>Named after Narg√πn, the month of Naras is a month that can have warm and sunny
	days as well as icy hailstorms. During Naras, it can even hail or snow a bit in
	south Salkamar and Gynk (although it never gets cold enough to snow in those areas
	during winter. Gynk is known for a lot of winter rain.)</p>

	<p>The month of Naras is known for quick changes in the weather, especially close to
	the coasts. In the Serin-planes, this effect is usually almost unnoticeable.</p>
