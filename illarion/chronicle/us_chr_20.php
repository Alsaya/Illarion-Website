   <p>In the year two of the new era in spring, cryptic things happen to the knights of the Grey
   Rose. Lennier seemed to be obsessed by a second soul, which controlled him after a
   self-inflicted poison attack. Together with several incidents in the Grey Rose&#39;s castle and
   other very conspicuous changes of his behaviour, an inner fight of the two creatures becomes
   apparent. Caged in the dungeon, accused of having stabbed a guard to death in a mental delusion,
   his friends don&#39;t turn away from him. As the dwarf and healer Gandela wrote down, Franjel
   Salem Long was able to end the fight between the two souls, which both wanted to be Lennier,
   with unknown methods. Hoping that Lennier was cured, he was freed after few days and after his
   mind was normal again.</p>

   to substitute the closed Academy. But the new Academy closes soon again.</p>

   <p>In the year two of the new era on april, the 25th, Badmosche (Grey Rose) challenges Darlok to
   a duel to end the &quot;war&quot;. During the duel Drakhen Vorkalion, who was attracted by

   Askhatuul.</p>
