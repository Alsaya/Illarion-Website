   <h1>The Troll&#39;s Bane Chronicle</h1>

   <h2>The first year of the new era: May</h2>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on may, the 9th, Khallja and Tinari married in Troll&#39;s
   Bane. It is the first wedding mentioned in the official documents.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era at the beginning of May, the ruins north of town were
   unearthed. Soon it was realised that the ruins are an execrated place where the ghosts of the
   dead are awaked to &quot;life&quot; as undeads.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on may, the 18th, Damien of the &quot;Grey Light&quot; asked
   the people of the &quot;Shadow Empire&quot; if it would be possible to aid one another, due to
   similar aims. No official arrangement was made.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era during May und June, the Grey Rose became decomposed slowly
   due to frequent absence of her leader. Soon after Aragon&#39;s joining Sturm Feuerklinge
   disappeared with the circle&#39;s money and wasn&#39;t seen again during several months. At this
   time Sirius Fellfuss, Echnaton and Aragon were active circle members.</p>
