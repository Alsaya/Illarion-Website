   <h1>Forums</h1>


   <?php cap(I); ?>
<p>llarion has a great forum where all or atleast most of the players congregrate to strengthen
 ingame ties, discuss illarion, and have other off-topic conversations.</p> 

<p>When you join Illarion and venture into the forums, there is a certain amont of maturity 
that is expected.</p>

<p>Rules that follow are suspected to be upheld in the forum at all times: </p>

<p><h2> On the boards the rules 2,3,5,6 and 13 apply. On the Roleplay Board and also the Guilds
 Board only role play (and no OOC) is allowed. Additionally the rules 8 and 11 apply. Posts
  concerning trading offers are unwanted. </h2></p>


<p>Rules which pertain to the forums (2, 3, 5, 6, and 13) are:</p> 

<b>2. Game Masters </b><br>

<p><h2>Some players have characters with Game master (GM) status. Their task is to keep
 order within the game. They can punish misbehavior in a number of unpleasant ways, or 
 notify administrators for some even more unpleasant punishment. These special characters
  should not be disturbed when busy, with the possible exception of very urgent cases. Lying
   to gamemasters, and exploiting bugs constitute serious offences, and will be dealt with harshly.
    The Game masters' privacy is respected. Their other characters will not be named unless specifically
	 requested by the GM him or herself. </h2> </p>


<b>3. Insults </b><br>
<p><h2>All insults directed at the person behind the screen, and not the character,
 are frowned upon, and will not be tolerated. Neither will all racist and/or sexist remarks. </h2></p>


<b>5. Bugs</b><br> 
<p><h2>Exploitation of bugs and errors (i.e. multi-copying of items, server crashing,...) are
 expressly forbidden. As soon as you find a bug or error, you should report it at this
 site: <a href="http://flyspray.illarion.org/">Flyspray</a> or send an email with a detailed description
  to <a href="mailto:bugs@illarion.org">bugs@illarion.org</a>. They should not be posted in the forum,
   because they could be abused by other players. If you lose skills or items in fact of server crashes
    or bugs you will not regain them. Quest items are the only exception </h2></p>


<b>6. Spamming </b><br>
<p><h2>Writing things that make no sense (e.g. iaosbrg93q8945#%=/), or very quickly is spamming,
 and is forbidden. The use of capitalized letters is omitted if you stress something (e.g. "IT'S MY
  TURN NOW!")</h2></p>


<p>Tip: Before you post, please try and add something useful to the game play rather than "I agree"
 or "I do not agree". If you do agree with a certain topic or opinion add more insight as to why it
  you like it. Please no insults either, as seen before. </p>

<b>13. Hacking</b>  
<p><h2>Any attempt to crash, damage, hack or spy on the server is highly forbidden.
 Modifying the client is prohibited by copyrights. </h2></p>


<p>Also, no OOC on guilds or Roleplaying board. These boards are purely to extend the ingame
 roleplay and conflicts going on. </p>

<p>If you obey these rules and contribute to the group, you will have no trouble at all. 
The forum is a place where ideas are expressed and roleplay is furthered.</p>
