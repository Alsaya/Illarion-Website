   <h2>1.3 What is Illarion?</h2>

   <p><em>Welcome traveller! We are encouraged to welcome you here in Trollsbane! Here you will
   find everything your heart wants! Adventures, strange races, a nice small House in the green!
   This place you will never forget!<br />
   <br />
   Procudus, guide to the city Trollsbane</em></p>

   <?php cap(B); ?>

   <p>efore you begin to play, you have to create a character. It is very easy at the moment: You
   have to choose &quot;create new&quot; at the beginning of the game and then a new window opens,
   there you can create your character. Please read the instruction manual in this handbook for
   more details.</p>

   <p>After the creation of your character your journey will start in the library of
   Trollsbane.</p>

   <p>So try to walk around and press the arrow keys in the desired direction. Maybe you want to
   read some books? There are much useful information!</p>

   <p>Stand in front of a bookshelf. Then press and hold the SHIFT -key down and then click on the
   bookshelf with your left mouse button once and your character once. After that you release the
   SHIFT -key to read a book.</p>

   <p>That sounds very easy, but maybe you have realized, that you didn&#39;t hit the bookshelf or
   your hero. It has a very simple reason: every time you want to click at something you have to
   click on the field where the object is standing on. If you want to click on your hero, then
   click on his feet not on his head, if you hit the right field the symbol of the object will
   appear in the upper right corner of the screen, right above the inventory-window of your
   character. Try it again - reading educates!</p>

   <p>After a little while, you found much information about Trollsbane and Illarion. Maybe you
   found some texts very often? Then isn&#39;t your character very experienced in searching for
   information ate the library. You will have to train the skill to gain more information from the
   large amount of books.</p>

   <p>Let&#39;s take a look at your skills: Click on &quot;Show skills&quot; at the right middle
   screen-edge below the character-drawing. Click on the arrow to the right in this section until
   you see the page with the &quot;magic skills&quot;. There you will find the skill &quot;library
   research&quot;. The colour of the words will be dark red and the more you are experienced the
   brighter the red will be.</p>

   <?php cap(T); ?>

   <p>o train a skill you must execute the activity again and again. But not the useless execution
   of the skill will be rewarded, only the useful and successful training will help you to gain
   experience. The more skilled you are the easier your life will be.</p>

   <p>The easier actions will lead more often to success than the complex actions. If you are more
   skilled, you will later be able to do more complex actions. (e.g. as a skilled smith you can
   smith heavy armours and not only simple daggers)</p>

   <p>If you leave the library you will recognize you don&#39;t have much money and only very few
   equipment. Only a hammer and a shovel, like the peasants on their fields.</p>

   <p>But you are dreaming of great huge mountains of gold, so that you can e.g. buy mighty
   weapons, so that your enemies will tremble if get close to them. But to you will have to work
   hard and long for that.</p>

   <p>So try to get armour and weapons, maybe some gold pieces.</p>

   <p>To reach it you could dig a bit for something valuable in the hills. Didn&#39;t you read
   something of gemstones in the hills of Trollsbane in the library? So go to the hills in the east
   of Trollsbane to dig for treasures.</p>

   <?php cap(T); ?>

   <p>o dig you must &quot;use the shovel with the hills&quot;: press the SHIFT -key and hold down,
   then click on the shovel with the left mouse button and click on a stone field next to your
   character and release the SHIFT -key. That&#39;s the way you always do actions in Illarion:
   press the SHIFT -key click on a reasonable combination of objects, then release the SHIFT -key.
   After some tries you will find some ore, coal and other stones.</p>

   <p>The stones aren&#39;t much worth, so decide to produce something with it.<br />
   After you found some coal and ore, use your hammer with the ore - that&#39;s the way you smith.
   To smith you need everytime some coal in addition. Sometimes you need additional objects, to do
   special actions. If you smith, you will get asked what to produce:</p>

   <p>You will see a menu at the left lower corner of your screen. You chose the Item you want to
   produce, if you hold down the SHIFT -key and click on the item with the left mouse button. If
   you click on it without the SHIFT -key, it shows you the name of the item.</p>

   <p>After you did dig some time in the hills and made some armament and things to sell, you
   should go to the dealer of the town in the shop. This is the big building with the inside
   yard.</p>

   <p>In the shop you will find two persons: A lizard named Eliza, who will buy most of your
   produced things, and a human, which sell you some things you will need maybe. You go to the
   lizard and use her with the things you want to sell. Hold down the SHIFT -key, click on the
   lizard once and on the item you want to sell once, then release the SHIFT -key. Maybe the lizard
   will take the items and pay you, but she won&#39;t buy everything.</p>

   <p>Now you own some money. Go to the human to buy some thread. Hold down the SHIFT -key and
   click on the human. Now you see a menu with items in it. Now hold down the SHIFT -key again and
   click on the thread.</p>

   <p>If you carry enough money with you, the human will take it and give you the Item you
   want.<br />
   Somewhere along the way you should smith a needle and procure some leather. Now you can sew a
   bag, if you use the needle with leather - additionally you will need the thread you bought
   before.</p>

   <?php cap(A); ?>

   <p>bag will appear in your backpack of your char sketch (on the right side , the second field
   from above) if you were successful. Now you can carry more then the six objects in your belt. If
   the belt is full, objects will now be put in your bag.</p>

   <p>To open the bag you have to click on it once with the right mouse button. Now you can see the
   content of your bag in the lower left corner of your screen. Next to the content-display are
   arrows placed, to the right and left - with these arrows you can scroll through your objects in
   the bag. To close the bag again, you have to click on the arrow up.</p>

   <p>You should put often used items in your belt and the rest in your bag, because it will take
   some time to find it in your bag.<br />
   While you are working in the hills or walk through the town, other creatures on their way
   through Illarion will cross your way. Some of them are &quot;veterans&quot; others are
   &quot;newcomers&quot; like you.</p>

   <p>To talk to them, you only have to type the text you want to write and press RETURN (ENTER).
   All persons on the screen will hear you (resp. read your words). If others talk, you will see a
   sentence, which starts with: &quot;Someone xyz says:&quot; (&quot;xyz&quot; is a unique number,
   which allows you to recognise this person later - as if you could remember the face of this
   person).</p>

   <?php cap(I); ?>

   <p>t seems so you doesn&#39;t know this person, so ask him if he introduces to you. If he does,
   you can now see his name instead of the number. Normally you will also be asked to introduce
   yourself (he either doesn&#39;t know you). If you like to introduce, you will have to type
   &quot;#introduce&quot; (or simply &quot;#i&quot;) and press RETURN</p>

   <p>Now the Characters in very close range to you know your name. After a little while you want
   to experience some adventures. Isn&#39;t that the reason why we are here?</p>

   <p>As a newcomer you decide to do some hunting. Go to the south-west part of the town. There you
   will find some pigs. Stand next to a pig, hold down the &quot;CONTROL -key&quot; (CTRL) and
   click with the left mouse button once on it.</p>

   <p>Around your &quot;enemy&quot; appears a red square. The fight will start, if you stand close
   enough to your &quot;enemy&quot;. Now you attack until one of you both escapes, die or you click
   on your &quot;enemy&quot; again, while you hold the &quot;CTRL -key&quot;, or you select another
   &quot;enemy&quot;</p>

   <p>Possibly the pig tries to escape while you attack it, so follow it! After you managed it to
   kill some of the pigs, you can try to fight against some &quot;real&quot; enemies. East oft the
   town you can search some flies. They are more courageous and will come to you to fight and
   attack you. You defend yourself everytime automatically in a combat.</p>

   <p>While you are fighting you will see the big red bar shrinking: This bar displays your health,
   if this bar is empty you will die. Because this isn&#39;t a very fine thing, you should retreat
   at the right time.</p>

   <p>If you die you will become a ghost (a cloud). Now you can&#39;t do anything except moving.
   You can&#39;t talk (only whisper), fight or use items. Now you should go to one of the yellow
   crosses. You have seen one in the south of the bridge of Trollsbane. If you reach the cross and
   some luck, the gods will revive you. If they do that, they will take some of your collected
   experience away - the price for your carelessness.</p>

   <?php cap(B); ?>

   <p>ecause fights at the beginning are dangerous, you should search other adventurers to fight
   together. Together you are strong! After some fights you become better and at last you can go
   hunting alone or search for stronger enemies. You should try to get better weapons and armoury
   to become a better fighter.</p>

   <p>Some characters want to become a great mage and other want to live consistent with the
   nature, like the famous Druids of the Forrest.</p>

   <p>If you want to use sorcery you have to decide between the mighty spells of the mages and the
   healing powers of the nature and their herbs, which can be used to brew many potions. But be
   careful! You can never reverse this decision!</p>

   <p>If you decide for magic, you have to read a book about magic runes at first. Druids have to
   read a book about herbs at first. Mages cast their spells by combining clear defined syllables.
   Druids will collect herbs and use them as ingredients for potions. While the druids work for
   their &quot;sorcery&quot;, the mages need magic powers called &quot;Mana&quot;. If a mage has
   used all his Mana, he won&#39;t be able to cast until his powers are
   regenerated.</p>

   <?php cap(T); ?>

   <p>o cast a spell magicians have to press the &quot;ALT&quot; key in order to see all runes you
   know. The spells are mostly built up by two runes. If you bought for example a few books with
   runes and learned these (by reading the books), you will be able to cast your first spell: Press
   &quot;ALT&quot;, click on the first rune of the spell and then on the second rune. Now click on
   an empty field on the map and release the &quot;ALT&quot; key again. You will see now how your
   character cast.</p>

   <p>Whether the spell was successful - you have to train your magic abilities as well - you will
   see a appearance in the target field whose appearance depends on the spell you cast. But
   caution: It would be an immense rule offence to direct a combat spell on you. Even at the
   beginning your spells won&#39;t work always what is indicated to you briefly by a small cloud
   around your character (it tells you that the spell is squibbed without any effect).</p>

   <p>A further useful spell is of course &quot;healing&quot;. You may speak this spell even on you
   for sure. (Information: the runes are numbered from above to downwards and from right to the
   left). Druids walk through the forests collecting herbs. Don&#39;t forget about the books. They
   will tell you where different herbs grow! For collecting herbs druids use a small sickle. So
   collect some firnis blossom for brewing a healing potion. In order to brew potions you need a
   mortar and some empty bottles to fill the potions in it. For brewing you press &quot;ALT&quot; -
   similar to the magicians - and click on the ingredients for the potion. Then you release the
   &quot;ALT&quot; key again.</p>

   <p>If you were successful and the recipe correct you will find a filled bottle in your bag. At
   the moment there aren&#39;t many different potions, therefore we let you find out further
   recipes by
   yourself.</p>
