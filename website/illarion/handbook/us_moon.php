<p>llarion is as you have probably read many times over is a game were you take on the role,
 adopt the habits and live as your character would for a time. In fact one of the hardest challenges
  awaiting a new player is being a living breathing part of a strange new world. One of the most 
  important aspects of character creation is there past you do not need to have a detailed past and
   certainly you don’t need an exciting one. Some of the best rpers and most influential people in
    the world of Illarion started there lives as farmers or street urchins. Creating a past for your
	 character will only enrich your character and make you seem more a part of the game to other players.</p>
	  
<p>The site <a href="http://www.moonsilver.de/index.htm">Moonsilver</a> has all the basic information
 you could need to pass yourself off as some one born and bred in the land of Illarion. 
Illarion is a unique fantasy setting and although it draws some inspiration from conventional
 myths reading about the races before decided what character play will enable you to pick a race
  that resembles your vision of what you want to portray and play in the game.</p>
   
<p>Lastly put possibly most importantly you will learn of the gods many of us in Illarion take
 the gods very seriously and even those who don’t are certainly not ignorant of them.</p>

<p>Imagine the scenario you are standing in the street looking around, some one walks up to you.<br />
<i>”Malachin’s blessings on you, lad” </i><br />
You reply: <i>“hmm, mala what?”</i><br />
Or you reply: <i>“No friend I am not a man for gods. My father, however, was a devote follower of Tanora”</i><br /> 
You have in that simple reply achieved two things you have got over the new player jitters by feeling 
competent in your response and made a statement that a seasoned or newer player can engage you through.
 This is just a simple example mind you by reading the site you will familiarize yourself with many
  names out legends, some of the creatures and crafts on the isle and finally enriched your ability
   to join us as a living breathing member of the world we love. </p>
