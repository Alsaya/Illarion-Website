   <h2>6.4.2 The magic-system of a druid</h2> 

   <?php cap(F); ?>

   <p>irst of all druids have to collect herbs with the sickle in the woods. If you use the sickle
   with different fields (forest, meadow, sand) you can collect different herbs. Afterwards you
   will need a mortar and an empty bottle. If combine the different herbs right you will get a
   potion. To brew you have to press &quot;ALT&quot; key like the mages.</p>

   <p>Now you see all herbs you know in section &quot;D&quot; - you will find them like the mages
   in certain books, which you can buy or find while you play. Click on all herbs you want to use.
   At the end you release the &quot;ALT&quot; key. If you were successful you will find a potion in
   your bag (remember: You have to carry a mortar and an empty bottle around in your
   inventory.).</p>

   <p>So try to brew a potion from firnis blossom. You will gain an effective healing potion. Try
   to discover the other receipts on your
   own!</p>
