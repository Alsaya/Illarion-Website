   <h2>1.2 What is it, role-playing?</h2> 

   <?php cap(M); ?>

   <p>any players think they are good roleplayer. By their definition you will control one or more
   characters and lead them trough a more or less pre-set storyline, in which you have to attain a
   goal (for example: the victory over an evil power) and with the performance of this goal the
   game ends.</p>

   <p>To attain the goal you have to rise your skills and gain experience. In Illarion is the
   definition different.</p>

   <p>There also Monsters to kill and the possibility to rise your skills, but at the end there are
   no winners and no losers. More important in Illarion is to communicate and interact with other
   characters, the storyline of Illarion will live from this, without it there will be
   stagnacy.</p>

   <p>Therefore it is so important that the player behind the character can identify himself with
   the figure and let his charakter talk and behave only in that way like the personality of his
   character (role) allows to react and behave in an medival
   fantasy-world.</p>
