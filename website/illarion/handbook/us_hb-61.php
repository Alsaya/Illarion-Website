   <h2>6.1 Carry on a trade</h2>

   <?php cap(A); ?>

   <p>t the beginning you should learn a trade at first, maybe specialise and so get to know
   Trollsbane and its inhabitants. You only own a hammer and a shovel you can dig with it for
   natural resources like coal or ore and afterwards smith tools, weapons and armoury.</p>

   <p>Other trades you could learn are e.g. lumberjack, tailor, carpenter, peasant, fisher or
   baker. You have to collect much experience in every profession to become a master of the
   profession.</p>
