   <h1>The Troll&#39;s Bane Chronicle</h1>

   <h2>The fourth year of the new era: October</h2>

<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 1st, the twelve days of election begin, for the vacant spot in the Triumvirate. During the election, there is a number of anonymous votes for the lizard Fooser, who is neither citizen of Troll's Bane nor a candidate.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 2nd, the Silverstar Merchants announce that they are looking for members. In the ensuing frame of time, Brendan Mason and Aristeaus are recruited by the guild.</p>

<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 12th, John Irenicus announces the result of the election for the open seat in the Triumvirate. Out of six candiates only two were even voted:10 votes for Caitlin Fergus, 5 votes for Neon Rift. Caitlin Fergus is declared member of the Triumvirate.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 12th, the depot chest of Sam, the town's merchant, and his partner Eliza, is stolen. As soon as it is noticed, huge commotion breaks loose in town. Suspicions spread out in every direction. The very same day, Lennier arranges a search through all the houses and caves upon the island, in order to retrieve the stolen depot.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 12th, Misjbar publishes a note, stating that his life has completely changed. He is no more Priest of the Five, instead serving Moshran only. The note also announces that he now withdraws from Troll's Bane and that only a few people would know his new whereabouts. Furthermore, he leaves the Elven community. As an appendix, he added an index to the message, listing friends and foes. The message meets a divided echo.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 13th, Sam's stolen depot is discovered by Caitlin Fergus, Lennier, Gorden Fisk, and Nedor von Largon. It was retrieved in the east, beyond the Trolls, where the depot chest of the Movement once had stood. According to reports concerning the transport of the depot back to Troll's Bane, the Trolls were somehow involved in the happenstance. Upon the chest's retrieval, Eliza and Sam identify the returned depot as their property.</p>

<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 16th, Jeremy Willowbrook suggests a cosmetic improvement of the mummy-infested ruins. It is written that he had already planted some trees there. This provokes a rather negative echo, for many inhabitants fear that this dangerous place might be mistaken for idyllic and may thus create more innocent victims.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 17th, Trolls of the eastern woods offer to remove the boulders blocking the pathways and city gates. In turn, the cutting of wood in the eastern forest and the hunting of Trolls would have to cease. The majority is for accepting this offer; however, some inhabitants are skeptical about a lasting peace with the Trolls.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 17th, a message of the cult leader Ceigan Ibatha appears, which attributes the offer of the Trolls as a result of the deeds of the followers of the Prancing Magenta Troll of Madness. They had eaten their socks even in dire times, upon which the Prancing Magenta Troll of Madness supposedly showed its gratitude.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 19th, Ereaes Eldermoor points out the often intrusion of skeletons within the town. He wishes for a change of these circumstances.</p>

<p>In the fourth year of the new era on October the 27th, Aristeaus declares the northeastern desert property of the city of Varshikar.
