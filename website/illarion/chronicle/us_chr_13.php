   <h1>The Troll&#39;s Bane Chronicle</h1>

   <h2>The first year of the new era: September </h2>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on September, the 1st the inhabitants of Troll&rsquo;s Bane, in
   particular the dwarves of the Ironhammer-Clan, are holding a ceremony in honour of their
   deceased king Udan and for the coronation of Caranthir to their new king. Surprisingly Caranthir
   failed to appear.</p>

   Roof&quot;-tournament has been held, which Corrin won.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on September, the 7th Tal Rash founds a necromancer-guild,
   later known as &quot;Riders of Moshran&quot;.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on September, the 17th Uruk Beastazuk, an orc with the power
   to rule the monsters, let them attack the town for unknown reasons.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on September, the 20th a memorial stone for the reminiscence
   of King Udan of the Ironhammer Clan has been raised. It can be found behind Eliza&rsquo;s Store.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on September, the 21st the Knights of the Grey Rose and the
   Order of the Grey Light declares war on Thoer for his continuous aggression and attacks on the
   knights and the inhabitants of Troll&rsquo;s Bane. In this war more guilds has been involved.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on September, the 24th the guildleader of the Knights of the
   Grey Rose, the Order of the Grey Rose, the Amazon Tribe and the Ironhammer Clan arranged a
   meeting to form an opinion about the further actions against Thoer. The same day the war ends,
   after many political implications, victourious with the intervention of the gods.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era , at the end of September/ beginning of Oktober the original
   inhabitants under the pseudonym &quot;The Blood Corpse&quot; threaten Illarion and demand a sign
   of good will.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on September, the 28th rumours were afloat about a
   disappearance of the libary. &quot;The Blood Corpse&quot; has been accused for its destruction.
   With the diplomatic skill of the Grey light and the Grey Rose an peaceful agreement can be
   achieved and harm to Illarion can be prevented. The libary reappears magically after some
   time.</p>
