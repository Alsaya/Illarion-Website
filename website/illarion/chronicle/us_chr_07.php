   <h1>The Troll&#39;s Bane Chronicle</h1>

   <h2>The first year of the new era: March</h2>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on march, the 11th, Galdriel discovers a narrow pass in the
   dense forests in the north west of the island. On another expedition, Galdriel and Bror discover
   ruins. According to a legend, a mage, searching for power, touched forbidden scrolls of the
   elder Gods inside a temple, causing an earthquake which destroyed the temple and the mage, and
   causing the forests to grow in a matter of seconds.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on march, the 11th, the &quot;Brotherhood of Light&quot;: is
   founded by Silver. They call themselves the third guild on the island. Their goals are to
   support newcomers, to pacify the streets and to trade.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on march, the 12th, the demon cave in the north east was
   explored for the first time and the &quot;Red Baron&quot; was discovered.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on march, the 12th, Master Gohan foundet the &quot;Order of
   Demonic Light&quot;.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on march, the 21st, Master Gohan discovered an ancient, barely
   readable scroll, foretelling the fall of Illarion. However, according to Damien, many faked
   scrolls are known. At the same time three transistor fields, emitting heat, are discovered. They
   seem to be portals for fire spirits, whose voices are heard by several people. A statue of
   Tanora was stolen. Different rituals allowed to reestablish balance between water and fire. The
   portals vanished.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on march, the 27th, finally Bror, Neon Rift and Olorin managed
   to free the statue of Tanora. It gets a new place on the eastern lagune and serves as a Tanora
   shrine since then. Neon Rift and Olorin are rewarded with rare fruits.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on march, the 27th, a warning for the notorious killer
   Darkwalker was spoken out for the first time. He also tried to stir up the Order of the Grey
   Light and the Order of Demonic Light against each other. At the beginning of april there are
   discussions within the Grey Light about the introduction of a police force. Darkwalker is
   executed on april, the 10th.</p>

   <p>In the year one of the new era on march, the 31th, Neon Rift had a vision of the future
   library. He draws plans basing on the vision and the Grey Light begins the construction.</p>
