   Br&aacute;gon was the first who left Illarion. But sometimes, he still visits it, and he has rebuilt
   one temple by himself - but there are no priests or believers to worship him there. He sometimes
   blesses people who sacrifice valuable things in his temple. When he left, he has given Malach&iacute;n
   the power over his former worshippers.</p>
