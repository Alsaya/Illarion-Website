	<h1>Chos</h1>

	<h2>Month of Commemoration</h2>

	<p>Chos was named after Cherga, the "Grey Mistress", who collects the souls of the
	deceased and brings them into the world on the other side of death. Many people that
	live in areas where it snows during winter don't have any possibility for farming
	during winter, and usually live from supplies gathered during the year.</p>

	<p>In southern Salkamar and Gynk, snow is extremely rare and in some places even
	completely unknown. Still almost all races, people and creeds have a memorial day
	for remembering the deceased during Chos. Followers and priests of Cheerga often
	hold ceremonies in well-heated chapels on cemeteries.</p>
