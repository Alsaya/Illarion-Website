	<h1>Adras</h1>

	<h2>Month of Intoxication</h2>

	<p>This month was named after Adron, the god of festivities and wine. A tavern feast
	is celebrated in Gynk from the 3rd to the 7th Adras and vintage festivals are held
	in many salkamaerian villages.</p>

	<p>Even in Albar there is a wine feast from the 17th to the 19th Adras, on which all
	citizens, even serfs and bondsmen, are allowed by law to drink themselves drunk with
	wine, which usually is only allowed for nobles.</p>

	<p>Some Albarian nobles in rural places give out cheap wine in the taverns for free
	during these days. A story tells of a greedy count who watered down the wine for the
	people and who was struck by Adron's curse : Every drop of wine that touched his
	lips changed into water until he paid back for his mistake tenfold.</p>
