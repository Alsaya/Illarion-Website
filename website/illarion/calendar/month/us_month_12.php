	<h1>Olos</h1>

	<h2>Month of Harvest</h2>

	<p>Olos was named after Oldra, the goddess of fertility and farming. In Albar and
	Salkamar, the 24th Olos is celebrated as a thanksgiving day. It is a widely known
	celebration day which is celebrated by many people and races with much devotion. An
	exception is the lizard people. their traditions and culture know little of farming
	and the harvesting of field crops. Lizardmen settlements usually ignore this day,
	but it often happens that lizards join the festivities when they visit places far
	from their homelands around this time.</p>

	<p>The priests of Oldra set the date of this day within the month of Olos, which is,
	in their opinion, a day which is blessed by the goddess, but people also say that
	weather and temperature conditions (and with this, the end of the harvest season)
	are a main reason in setting the date. There are some local differences in how the
	festivities are celebrated, but they are usually done with processions, and then
	religious speeches and grain or fruit sacrifices, which then end with a big feast
	in the evenings. Especially in poorer settlements, this day is looked forward to
	because this is one of the few days that brings nourishment in satisfying amounts.
	</p>

	<p>This tradition is frowned upon in Albar, since the worshipping of Oldra (who is a
	female goddess) is forbidden since about five hundred years. However, the
	thanksgiving feast is allowed, even though it is forbidden to say or express the
	name "Oldra" in any form.</p>
