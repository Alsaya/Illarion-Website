<h2>RPG/Role playing?</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="question">Every one keeps talking of RPG and Role playing. What is that?</li>

	<li class="answer">Role playing games (RPG) are a popular genre of games, where players
	immerse themselves completely into the life of their character. You cease to be yourself, and
	instead lead the life of a fictional character feeling, saying and thinking what he would. In
	the case of Illarion, the world is a medieval fantasy realm with orcs, dwarves magic and
	monsters. Your character could be a renowned warrior, a potent mage, a rich craftsman, or
	even a poor beggar groveling in the gutter. The choice is all yours. An important aspect of
	role playing is the character interaction that is bound to happen. Whether you are a merchant
	offering his wares, A pompous baron oppressing the peasants, or a warrior seeking to prove
	his worth; Become your character. Speak, think and act as he/she would. If you are a peasant,
	speak with a crude accent. If you are grand mage, make yourself appear mystical and eerie. If
	you immerse yourself completely in your character, you will truly become him, feeling his
	highs and lows. Who knows, you might even fall in love and marry? Another source of Role
	playing is the rpg boards in the Illarion forum. On these you can organize or participate in
	virtually anything. The other players will be more than happy to help you, whether you wish
	to go on a quest to find your estranged parents, or you want to organize your own wedding.
	Let them interact and influence your character's life, and try to play a part in their
	story. There are virtually no limits to what you can do! A rule to observe though: Keep the
	posts on the rpg and guild boards IC (in Character) i.e. Speak as you would in the game - as
	your character does. OOC (Out of character; i.e. how you, the person behind the screen of
	your pc, would speak) Is allowed on the other boards. All this is to promote Role playing.
	Many other games that call themselves rpg's, do not actually feature any role playing. If
	this concept does not interest you, then Illarion is probably not the game for you. (for more
	information, have a look at "About the project")</li>

<h2>Weapon/armour strength</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="question">How do I know the precise weapon strengths?</li>

	<li class="answer">You don't. We try to make Illarion as realistic as possible, and in
	medieval times, you simply would not hear a weapon smith say "This sword has an attack
	value of 20". Instead people tried out several swords, and decided then which one suited
	them best. The weapons do have specific values, but those are decided by many factors, i.e.
	the skill of the smith, and the quality of the ore the item was made form, so we cannot give
	you a numerical value anyway. Some people have been complaining that you should at least be
	able to see rough values, but for this, simply think. A dagger does not inflict as much pain
	as a battle axe, but it is much faster. A short sword would be somewhere in between.</li>

<h2>Skill values/attributes</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="question">Where can I see my exact skill levels and attributes?</li>

	<li class="answer">Once again, we stress realism in Illarion. A person cannot be reduced to a
	numerical value. Just imagine, you sit on a bench somewhere and overhear a conversation. A
	person says " I increased my running skill to level 40 yesterday, and levelled up to
	level 43." I am sure you would laugh pretty hard at that person if he said that. Well,
	the same counts in Illarion. You can see rough values in the form of a bar graph in the skill
	list (as you can always compare yourself roughly to other people). Also, it is very annoying
	to always hear someone bragging about their skills, wherever you go. Imagine this; you are
	sitting in the tavern, enjoying a chat with a close friend about the new politics of the
	elderly king. Suddenly someone behind you starts yelling that he is level 10 in carpentry,
	and can thus make good items for you. It does not get much more annoying than that. It would
	be simpler to have a precise skill system, but we did create this game in the spirit of Role
	playing. If you disagree with this, Illarion might not be the game for you.</li>

<h2>Global chat</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="question">How do I send global chat messages?</li>

	<li class="answer">You can't. How would you do that in medieval times anyway? There were
	no P.A. systems, or radios so such things were impossible. We might grant powerful mages a
	special ability to communicate by telepathy but nothing is planned yet. If you need to spread
	a message, you can always hire another player as a town crier.</li>
